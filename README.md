# Dad’s Carb Tracker

Dad’s Carb Tracker is a simple web app for logging and tracking daily carbohydrate intake.  
Originally built for my father, who has diabetes, the app makes it easy to log meals, see daily totals, and view a 7-day average of carbs consumed.

The app uses the Nutritionix API to analyze natural language food input like "2 eggs and toast" and automatically estimates carb values.
